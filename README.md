Python Movie Barcode Creator
=============================

This is a simple script to create "barcodes" from frames of a movie. This works by using ffmpeg to create images from the frames of the video. Then uses [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) to extract the dominant color from each frame and then string them together into a "barcode."

Installation:
-------------

This script can be installed via pip (either python2 or 3):

    pip install moviebarcodecreator

This will also install all dependencies. Or you can install it manually via:

    python setup.py install

Usage:
------

From the command line, go to the directory the video file is in and type:

    moviebarcode VideoFileName.mpg

And a barcode.png file will be generated, as well as a frame_colors.txt file for faster barcode generation if you ever want to change the size in the future.

###Options:

#####-o, --outfile OUTFILENAME               

Name of the generated barcode png. Default is barcode.

####-h, --help

Display the help information.

####-fc, --framecolors

Use this if your already have a frame_colors.txt generated to skip frame and color generation. (Can't be used at the same time as -nf).

####-nf, --noframes

Use this if you already have the movie frames inside a frames directory inside the video directory. This will skip the frame generation process. (Can't be used at the same time as -fc).

*Note: With both -fc and -nf you do not have to specify a video file name if either are used.*

####-nd, --nodelete

The default behavior for the script is to delete all the frames it generates when it's done. Add this -nd flag and the frames directory and all the frames won't be deleted.

####-ht, --height HEIGHT

Set the image height in pixels. Default is 1200px.

####-bw, --barwidth BARWIDTH

Set the width of each bar, before the image get's resized to its final width. Default is 5px.

####-w, --width WIDTH

Set the final width of the barcode in pixels. Default is 1920px.

####-fr, --framerate FRAMERATE

You can set FFMPEG's frame rate with this. Default is 1/24. Keep in mind, the higher you set the framerate, the more frames are going to be generated and the longer the process will take.

####-t, --threads THREADS

You can set the amount of threads python will use when generating the colors for the barcode. Default is 8.

####Generate a barcode for a video that is 500x500 without deleting the frames:

    moviebarcode VideoFileName.mpg -ht 500 -w 500 -nd

####Generate a barcode from previously generated frames and name the barcode test.png:

    moviebarcode -nf -o test.png

####Generate a barcode from previously generated frame colors:

    moviebarcode -fc

####Generate a barcode with a higher framerate and more threads:

    moviebarcode VideoFileName.mpg -fr 1/2 -t 16
